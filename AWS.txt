This code uses deploys an AWS Jenkins Pipeline.\\
\ding{230}  How to do this? First, we create the file system (FS), saving its ID. Then we create two sets of security groups (SG). the first SG sets will be attached to the instances, and allow access from all ports. The second sets of SGs will be attached to the EFS mounting points and will be accessible from port 2049 from the instance SG. After than, we will create two mount targets (MT), one for each subnet containing an instance. We will secure the MT's ids and DNS. At this point, we can spin two instances, each in a different subnet. We would need to create a key pair first. We will secure the instance IP and ID. After that, we need to install the EFS FS in each intance, and that's about it. The last part of the script cleans up the FS, the MT, SG and stop all instances. \\
